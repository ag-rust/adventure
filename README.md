A simple text adventure game, in Rust.

I used to write a text adventure in every new language I learned. Might as well
write one in Rust. :smile:

I am still a n00b at Rust so this code may not be the best.


Try it out:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/steveklabnik/adventure.git
$ cd adventure
$ cargo run
```
